Fine, here’s your README. Pretend you wrote it yourself after a late-night coding session fueled by cheap coffee:

# 🐍 Python OOP Assignment

This repository contains solutions for **Week 4 Python OOP challenges**:

## 📘 task 1: Design Your Own Class

* Implemented a **Superhero** class with attributes like `name`, `power`, and `city`.
* Added subclasses `FlyingHero` and `TechHero` to demonstrate **inheritance** and **method overriding**.
* Each subclass has its own version of `use_power()` to show **polymorphism** in action.

**Run the file:**

```bash
python superhero.py
```

Expected output (example):

```
I am Skyblade, guardian of Metropolis! 💥
Skyblade soars at 900 km/h while unleashing Wind Slash! 🦸‍♂️
I am Gearmaster, guardian of Neo-Tokyo! 💥
Gearmaster uses high-tech gadgets (Drone, Exo-suit) to perform Laser Barrage! 🤖
```

## 🎭task 2: Polymorphism Challenge

* Created a `Vehicle` base class with subclasses:

  * `Car` → prints `"Driving 🚗"`
  * `Plane` → prints `"Flying ✈️"`
  * `Boat` → prints `"Sailing 🚤"`

**Run the file:**

```bash
python vehicles.py
```

Expected output:

```
Driving 🚗
Flying ✈️
Sailing 🚤
```

## 🚀 Outcomes

By completing these activities, you’ll:

* Understand **classes, constructors, and attributes**.
* Explore **inheritance and encapsulation**.
* See **polymorphism** in practice with shared methods (`use_power`, `move`).

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.x installed
* Run using VS Code or terminal

Would you like me to also **merge both parts into a single demo script** (so your tutor runs just one file and sees everything), or do you prefer keeping them separate?
